# Inheritence--overriding-toString-method
Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, telephone number and email address. A student has a Class status(freshman, sophomore, junior or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the person&amp;#39;s name.
